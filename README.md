## Guide

LUKS_LVM_UEFI/LUKS_BTRFS_UEFI is a guide for installing Arch Linux with LUKS disk encryption over a UEFI based system.

## What is this?

While I was further exploring the linux universe seeking the answer to the meaning of life, I met a challenge of never matched difficulty: full disk encryption using LUKS over a UEFI based system. Many are the guides available on the web but none of them fullfilled my thirst for knowledge, as some were for older non-GPT installs or a bit too vague for a first time approach of the argument.

## Avaliable guides

- LVM on LUKS, a standard install using well tested and stable tools.
- BTRFS on LUKS, a standard install using well tested and stable tools.
- Both guides tested on Arch Linux.
